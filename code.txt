work in virtual enviroment. this example we r not doing it.

step 1: git init
step 2 : dvc init 
3 : connect git repo to local repo : create git repo then in terminal : git remote add origin https://github.com/leonmoraes17/dvc-demo.git
--origin is the name we giving our repo.
4. add remote for dvc = dvc remote add -d myremote D:\Projects\temp_folder_dvc  ( temp_folder_dvc id the remote folder for storing data , this can be a s3 url as well )

5. now we create data_ingestion file and ran the python file and customer.csv was created in data folder
Since data files are not tracked in github we are going to track it using DVC , so we write the function
dvc add data/customer.csv ==== this will add the csv for tracking 
When we run this command two things happen
a. dvc folder - CAche folder is created - customer.csv goes in stagin area and contains data of customer.csv.dvc  
b. data folder now has customer.csv and customer.csv.dvc(meta data of customer.csv) and gitignore file is updated to ignore customer.csv file.

6. git add . == this will add the data_ingestion file and customer.csv.dvc file. The customer.csv file is in gitignore file so wont be tracked
7. git commit
